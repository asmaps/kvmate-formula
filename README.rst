==============

This repository contains a salt state for deploying kvmate. It actually
supports most django projects by changing its parameters via pillar. This
repository is regulary mirrored from a collection of salt states at
`danieljn/salt-states`_. This means it's best to **not** push into the
``django`` subdirectory.
